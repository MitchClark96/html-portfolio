<h1>The best movies according to Mitch </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>#1 Tenet</h3>
<p>I really like Christopher Nolan movies, this one is my favorite so far</p>
<h4>#2 Hereditary</h4>
<p>Big fan of scary movies, but I am pretty particular. This one is as close as it gets for my favorite horror film</p>
<h5>#7 Kill Bill 1&2</h5>
<p>Of course I love Quentin Tarantino movies, just as much as I love watching a well choreographed sword fight</p>
